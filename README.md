<h1 align="center"><strong>Streaming Analysis</strong></h1>

# Changes to Project Plan
I turned in my Project Plan when I only had my Netflix streaming data. Since then, I've been able to obtain my Hulu and Prime Video streaming data. 

This project will use all three datasets (Hulu, Netflix, Prime Video) instead of only Netflix.

# Introduction

Project objective: (what you expect the project to do) *
This project will analyze viewing data from Netflix and see how it compares to popular tv and movies. 

Statement of Work:  (what work needs to be done) *
I need to gather the data, add to a Jupyter Notebook, and explore the data.

## Feature 1
Read TWO data files (JSON, CSV, Excel, etc.). 

## Feature 2
Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set.  

## Feature 3
Make 3 matplotlib or seaborn (or another plotting library) visualizations to display your data.

## Feature 4
Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up

## Feature 5
Annotate your code with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, write clear code comments, and have a well-written README.md. Tidy up your notebook, and make sure you don’t have any empty cells or incomplete cells that don’t do anything. Make sure it’s all functional before your final github commit.
